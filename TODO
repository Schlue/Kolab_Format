====================================
 Kolab_Format Development TODO List
====================================

 - Find a decent way of handling tags within Horde 4

 - Remove dependency on the Horde_Nls and Horde_String language
   settings. I currently assume we should only return UTF-8 from this
   library.

 - Remove the automatic handling of Horde preferences within this
   package. This is a task that belongs into the application NOT into
   this package.

 - Remove the charset conversion. It is perfectly fine to have a
   package that expects all data in utf-8 format. Let the applications
   handle the rest.

 - Remove the use of the Horde_Date class from testing. It should be
   no problem to get the same code coverage without using the external
   class.

 - Ultimately only the dependency on Horde_Exception should remain.

 - Think about storing the data in iCal format.
