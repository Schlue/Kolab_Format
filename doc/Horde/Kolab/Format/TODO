====================================
 Kolab_Format Development TODO List
====================================

 - Test new Horde_Kolab_Format_Date functions.

 - AllDay events

 - Recurrence start handling

 - Remove the use of the Horde_Date class from testing. It should be
   no problem to get the same code coverage without using the external
   class.

 - better internal api version support

 - performance check

 - cleanup handlers.

 - Think about storing the data in iCal format.

 - Check kolab/issue4672 (Kolab_Format has encoding problems)
